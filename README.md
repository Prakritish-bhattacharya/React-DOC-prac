# To update a component with new data, two things need to happen:
    1) Retain the data between renders.
    2) Trigger React to render the component with new data (re-rendering).
# The useState Hook provides those two things:
    1) A state variable to retain the data between renders.
    2) A state setter function to update the variable and trigger React to render the component again.
